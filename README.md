# Two floor elevator system finite state machine
This repository is a Finite State Machine for a two floor elevator system that I have made
written in C.

## What is Finite State Machine (FSM)?

An FSM is a computation/mathematical model used to simulate some computer programs and sequential logic.
It has a finite amount of states and can only be in one state at a given time. It can change between states and produce outputs
in response to given inputs.
